	<h1>Quality: About This Data Set</h1>
        <p>In general, the data quality is clean and complete with very few missing and mismatched data. 
        The dataset is organized and has consistency in both language and format across the board.</p>
      </div>

    
      <div class="page-header">
		<h2>Is the data complete?</h2>
		<p>I used Trifacta to wrangle this dataset. In two of the columns, "Deaths" and "Age_adjusted_Death_Rate", about 1% of the data is missing. 
		This can be result in misleading results when people conduct further quantitative anlysis related to age and number of deaths, whether by states, or by other criteria.</p>

      <div class="page-header">
		<h2>Is the data coherent?</h2>
		<p>The data is well organized and make sense relative to itself and it does match my expectations. 
		I used the chart in Google Fusiontable to do simple visualizations of the dataset. Overall, the data distribution seems to follow a sensible pattern. However,
		there are some outliners for "All Causes" under "Cause_Name" category. In 2007, the number was significantly higher than other years, and other causes, which
		might need further examination if we want to use the dataset for analysis.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-header">
		<h2>Is the data correct?</h2>
		<p>What aspects of this data can you verify? How did you do so? What did
		you find?
		On the high level, I used Trifacta to do some basic data cleaning. Under the "State" column, there are some mismatched value under "State" 
		colunm where instead of a state's name, it wrote "United States". I couldn't verify whether it's a mistake or intentional. The numbers are usually 
		significantly larger than other states in the same disease category. I decided to eliminate those data from the dataset. Otherwise, I also looked for 
		other resources in leading causes of death in the united states, but I haven't found one as comprehensive as the one published by NCHS. I briefly 
		looked through the same dataset published in previous years, and there aren't much discrepancy. Thus, I consider this data generally correct.</p>
